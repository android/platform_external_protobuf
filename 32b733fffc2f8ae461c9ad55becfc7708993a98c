I would have expected it to conflict with module java.base for target, but apparently not? \n\nI couldn\u0027t find where the build target libprotobuf-java-lite lives, is that prebuilt? What is the target that actually breaks if it doesn\u0027t find the Unsafe class? In what .mk / .bp file is that make target defined?",

But I remember that we now only have a single system module target that includes core-all, so it makes sense that we use \"none\" for all the stub cases (I actually wrote this logic myself but I forget the details :-D). So, as long as your CL builds, it should be fine.",
