      "message": "I would move these to public: void set_bytes_offset_length(bool value), so IDEs can show this to the user more readily than here.\n\n- actually, maybe also change the byte[] field name to [fieldName]Buffer, just to prevent misuse. Then \"adds offset/length fields\" becomes \"uses buffer/offset/length tuples\".\n- not all byte fields; only the required and optional ones (not repeated).\n- add the deserialization behavior (just say the byte buffer is the same instance as that backing the CodedInputByteBufferNano)\n- clarify that \"offset !\u003d -1\" is the field presence signal.\n- \"This feature comes with no SLA\" :)",
