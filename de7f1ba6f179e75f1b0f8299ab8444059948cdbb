      "message": "Although it won\u0027t be used at runtime, this\u0027ll end up in the resulting module. It probably makes more sense to have a new module for this and not include it as a static dep.\n\nTo avoid dealing with license complexity, it probably also makes sense to add something in libcore rather than here: like we have for libcore/ojluni/src/lambda but without the public jar (perhaps ojluni/src/internals to avoid making it just about \"Unsafe\", although I can\u0027t think of any other classes in this category).\n\nThis wouldn\u0027t be to solve the same need as our lambda stubs (ojluni/src/lambda is to deal with compile-time compiler dependencies we can\u0027t do anything about) but it\u0027s similar. We\u0027d need some good docs in a README to make it clear it\u0027s for compile-time dependencies on classes like sun.misc.Unsafe.",
